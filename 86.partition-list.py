#
# Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than
# x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
# 
# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
# two partitions.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
# Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
# 
# 
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # two pointers
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        small_head = small = ListNode(0)
        large_head=large = ListNode(0)

        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                small.next = head
                small = small.next
            else:
                large.next = head
                large = large.next
            head = head.next
        # don't forget to set the last one's next as None
        large.next = None
        small.next = large_head.next
        return small_head.next
