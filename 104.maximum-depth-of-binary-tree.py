#
# Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
# 
# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
# node down to the farthest leaf node.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
# 
# 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# 
# return its depth = 3.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # dfs
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            l = dfs(node.left)
            r = dfs(node.right)
            return max(l+1, r+1)

        res = dfs(root)
        return res
