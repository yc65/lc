# Testcase Example:  '123'
#
# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 123
# Output: 321
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: -123
# Output: -321
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: 120
# Output: 21
# 
# 
# Note:
# Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers
# within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose
# of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed
# integer overflows.
#
