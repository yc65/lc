#
# Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
# 
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the
# root node down to the nearest leaf node.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
# 
# 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# 
# return its minimum depth = 2.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def recur(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            l = recur(node.left)
            r = recur(node.right)
            if not l:
                return r+1
            if not r:
                return l+1
            return min(l, r)+1
        return recur(root)
