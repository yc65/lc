#
# Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such
# that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum
# of zero.
# 
# Note:
# 
# The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
# 
# A solution set is:
# [
# ⁠ [-1, 0, 1],
# ⁠ [-1, -1, 2]
# ]
#
