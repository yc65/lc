# Testcase Example:  '[-10,-3,0,5,9]'
#
# Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a
# height balanced BST.
# 
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree
# in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more
# than 1.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
# 
# One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following
# height balanced BST:
# 
# ⁠     0
# ⁠    / \
# ⁠  -3   9
# ⁠  /   /
# ⁠-10  5
#

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # tree traversal
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        def recur(nums):
            if nums:
                mid = len(nums)//2
                root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
                root.left = recur(nums[:mid])
                root.right = recur(nums[mid+1:])
                return root
        return recur(nums)
